      <p id="article-body-1">“The future of Philippine cinema demands it. The voice of artists demands it. Labanan po ng lahat corruption at supportahan ang sining,” Deputy Festival Director Tess Rances said during the opening ceremony held in Mandaluyong City, Friday. “We call on lawmakers to act with urgency against corruption that stifles  creativity and to channel resources towards fostering artistic excellence.” Rances stressed that “corruption kills artistry,” warning that many  Filipino filmmakers are robbed of the chance to showcase their talent as they continue to struggle to bring their stories to life.</p>
      <p id="article-body-2">Here are the films of Cinemalaya 2025. “While billions of taxpayer money are skimmed from ghost projects under the noses of lawmakers who are supposed to safeguard them, artists scrape the bottom of the pot to bring stories to life,” she admonished. Cinemalaya has long been a launchpad for Filipino filmmakers, with many of its entries gaining international recognition. But unfortunately Rances explained the festival remains financially “fragile” —  with its future nearly cut short by the lack of steady funding.“If not for urgent efforts of Cinemalaya Foundation, FDCP, and CCP to soruce out budget needed  to subisduze the 10 and films the festival would not be possible,” she reasoned. “We urge govt to prioritize allocation of funds to support the arts like Cinemalaya, CCP, and FDCP that nurtures the growth indie film,” she added.</p>
      <p id="article-body-3">Cinemalaya will screen ten short films and ten full length features from Oct 3-12 at select partner cinemas.</p>
